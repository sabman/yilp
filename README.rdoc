In simple terms, the Service allows you to look up the unique identifier - called the Where on Earth ID, or WOEID - for
almost any named place on the Earth; it also allows you to resolve a WOEID you have received from a third party - such as
Fire Eagleâ„¢ or Upcoming - to the place it represents.

The API is accessed via HTTP GET; the following examples can be cut-and-paste into a web browser to view the results:
